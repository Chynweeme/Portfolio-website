    <h1>
        This is my practice one. For type selector, we style our elements <br>
        using the tag name.
    </h1>

    <p>Another type selector</p>

    <h2>
        You will find a lot of colors here, so please bear with me....
    </h2>
    <h1 class="header-one">
        This is a class selector. Class selectors are styled by first having <br>
        the class attribute in the opening tag of the element. Give a name to the <br>
        class attribute. Then go to your external css to style the class... To do this,<br>
        first add a dot(.) sign before the name of the class in order for the class <br>
        selector to work.
    </h1>

    <p class="header-one">
        Class selector in use
    </p>

    <h3 id="identity-selector">
        This is ID selector. It is similar to class selector, except that with id selector,<br>
        you can only use it for one element at a time. YOu can not use it for multiple elements, <br>
        however class selectors can be used for as many elements as you want. We need <br>
        id attribute for id selector. After putting the id attribute in the opening tag of the html <br>
        file, head over to the external css file and style it using the id selector. To style it in the <br>
        external css file, use the ash sign (#) first before the id name.
    </h3>

    <h3 id="identity-selector-2">Will this work?</h3>

    <div class="parent">

        <p>Child selector is the selector that allows us pick the child of an element. In child <br>
            selector, we do not need child attribute... there is nothin like child attrubute.. lol <br>
            however, we just need to go to the external css file, pick the name of the parent tag, in <br>
            this cas it is "div", give a space and then use the "greater than sign" (>), a space bar <br>
            and then the child element, which in this case is the "p" tag. <br>
            <span> Note: Always remember to use the greater than sign for the child selector. And never forget <br>
            to close your css styling with a semi-colon! <br>
            Let me quickly explain descendant selector. A descendant selector is used to pick the child element <br>
            of a child element: like the grand child. Lol. To do this, you could either go through the child selector <br>
            path and use your greater than sign in two places, or you can just use the descendant selector by <br>
            calling out the parent selector and then giving a space and calling the grandchild selector immediately</span>
